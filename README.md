# End To End ML Project From Research To Production

## Predicting Sale Price of Houses

The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model to predict the sale price of homes based on different explanatory variables describing aspects of residential houses.

## Why is this important?

Predicting house prices is useful to identify fruitful investments or to determine whether the price advertised for a house is over or under-estimated.

In this project we will use the house price dataset available in [**kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

we have 81 features in our dataset.

## Project Structure

### 1. Research phase
---
In this part wi will do the following:

- **1. Data Analysis**
- **2. Feature Engineering**
- **3. Feature Selection**
- **4. Model Training**
- **5. Model Evaluation**
- **6. create a nice pipeline to use the model in production**

### 2. Production Phase
